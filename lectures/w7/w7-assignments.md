## Interactive Type Poster
Now, you know how to design your own parametric type system as well as how to use the existing typefaces and build a composition. Using all the techniques we've learned so far, create a type poster design (you can use other elements but the type should be the main thing) that users can interact with.

The theme of the poster is *The Future of Typography*. The details are up to you - whether you want to be experimental or give a specific context. How would you interpret it? Say what you want to say. Say what you learn from others. Do some research first. 

Some questions you might ask yourself - What would it be like to communicate with dynamic typefaces, typography and/or contents? What would typographic environment be like? Is the future already here? Or do you imagine the future differently? Do you want to predict the future or create one? You can sepculate. We still use the types designed hundreds of years ago, and the future may not be so different? What will remain and what will change? 

You may have realized that the way we work in this class is different from what you are used to. We don't just create a static outcome. Adobe tools can help you visualize but not enough. They don't show us how the animation and interaction will play out. You could probably use After Effects or other prototyping tools to create animation or simulated interactions, but it may actually take more time to do so than simply coding. It's also difficult to make changes that way. 

So, what you will have to do is that you can use Photoshop/Illustrator to sketch out ideas and start building the compositions, but you will want to quickly create interactive prototypes to test and revise, to explore the space with parameters. With this project, develop your own design process to create dynamic systems. Use time and interaction as variables of your design. How would you use these to create an effective/engaging/memorable poster design?
  
### Requirements

- Use `windowWidth`, `windowHeight` and other variables so that your poster will work at *any* screen sizes. In other words, make it responsive to different screen dimensions.
- Your interaction should have intentions, not random or arbitrary (unless randomness itself is your intention).
- Pay attention to how dynamic composition, animation and interactions can help storytelling.
- You may add extra graphics in addition to type.
- You may use any kind of graphics. For example, you can make graphics in Photoshop or Illustrator, and load them into p5. Or generate the graphics dynamically within p5.

### Schedule

#### Week 7
Project begins:
- research on your subject
- research on techniques you want to use
- examples of code/techniques you want to look into
- static mockup design
- first interactive prototype (a proof of concept)
- Present your research component in a nice PDF format.

#### Week 8
Present research & first prototypes

#### Week 9
No class - Spring break.

#### Week 10
work

#### Week 11
Final presentation
