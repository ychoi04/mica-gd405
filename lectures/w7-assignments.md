## Interactive Type Poster
This will be a 2-week (3-week including the Spring Break) assignment. Using all the techniques we've learned so far, create an interactive poster design (you can use other elements but the type should be the main thing) that users can interact with.

Choose one of your favorite films and create an interactive type poster based on your own interpretation (please do not be literal). Think beyond what's already possible with more traditional ways of communication as you can use the animation and user interaction.

You can use Photoshop/Illustrator to sketch out ideas and start building the compositions, but you will want to quickly create interactive prototypes to test and revise, to explore the design space with parameters. Use time and interaction as variables of your design. How would you use these to create an effective/engaging/memorable poster design?
  
### Requirements
- Your design/interaction should be based on the contents and your intentions, not random or arbitrary (unless randomness itself is your intention).
- Pay attention to how dynamic composition, animation and interactions can help storytelling.
- You may use your own type design or use any existing typefaces.
- You may add extra graphics in addition to type.
- You may use any kind of graphics. For example, you can make graphics in Photoshop or Illustrator, and load them into Processing. Look at how to use a `PImage`(image) or `PShape`(vector) objects. Or generate the graphics dynamically within Processing.

This is a 2-week assignment (3-week if we include the Spring Break). This week, do some research and make quick sketches to test out your ideas. Bring back the first interactive prototype. Don't forget to document your process along the way.

- research on your subject
- research on techniques you want to use
- look for examples of code/techniques (Processing.org forum, openprocessing.org, creativeapplications.net, github.com)
- static mockup design
- first interactive prototype (a proof of concept)
- challenge yourself but also be realistic.
