## Drawing type
Design 3 words — type, form, and code — based on rules and conditions you set. Each word should employ different rules, therefore, they should be designed in different visual styles. Letters in each word should have some uniformity.

For example, one of the words may only use circles. Another one may only use diagonals. Another one may use lines emanating from the center, etc. But, don’t take these examples literally and experiment. 

We haven’t yet learned how to connect variables to control the form, but this should be one of the considerations while doing this assignment — how computational typography can be different from the more traditionally designed types. Our end goal is not to just design a set of type forms. It is to create a system with rules and variables that can respond to different conditions to generate different outcomes dynamically. What properties of your type design do you want to control to make it responsive or interactive?

*Assignments can give you a better idea on what area to pursue for the final project. You may be asked to develop any previous assignments more later.*

### Deliverables
  - 3 different codepen links posted on Google Doc. Save the p5.js sketch files for your own record and you may be asked later to submit as files, not web links.
  - Images(screen captures) of your design. Post them on Week 2 folder.
  - Also, print your images on paper.
