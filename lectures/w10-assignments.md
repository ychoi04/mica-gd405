# Week 10 assignments

## Tutorial

One of the best ways to learn is to teach or help other people. This week's assignment is for you to write or video record a tutorial on a topic related to generative typography.

- Write a tutorial with code examples and post on Google Drive. Or, you could, alternatively, record a video tutorial and post the video file along with the finished code.
- Find an interesting topic that *hasn't been covered in class*, and share it with us. It could be something you wanted to learn, or something you have already tried in any prior assignments. Share your tips & techniques. Share your mistakes.
- It does not have to be overly complex, but do not pick something that is too easy or basic. Challenge yourself a little, but do not choose something you don't understand. Also, don't just copy and paste what's already out there. If you find something interesting, first make it your own and add your own contents to it.
- It should take no more than 10-15 minutes to follow your tutorial.
- When we meet next time, we will try out your tutorials.

## Final project
Initial research - present **two different ideas**. Refer to [the final project brief](proj-final.md). Present them as PDF format.
