# Week 5 assignments

## Part 1: develop your type design

As we continue to think about the "constructed" letterforms and the system, we should not just focus on the technical aspect (coding). Start by defining your own goals. How does your work relate to other existing projects? What problems are you trying to solve? How do you want people to use your design? What is missing or weak in the current version?

This week, I would like you to find your own direction to develop your design further based on what you already have. Add a few more letters to your type design, refine the forms, add more interactions and parameters, etc. 



### Part 2: Let's put our type to use!

We will see how our type design holds up in a different context by making a type poster.

- Create a poster that showcases what your type design can do.
- Before we get into making our posters interactive, we will work on a static poster this time so that we can pay more attention to control forms and compositions. As the poster is a static medium, animation/interactions will not work on paper. Instead, think about other effective ways of showing your types' personalities. For example, use repetitions and [small multiples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple). What is interesting about designing programmatically? You can think of this poster image as a promotional material for your type.
- If you export PDF out of Processing, then you can open the file in Illustrator and make fine adjustments.
- You may combine the elements from other sketches/softwares.
- Use 11 x 17 inch format. Vertical orientation only.
- Upload the finalized poster image file (PDF or PNG) on Google Drive.
- This poster will later be used for magnetic boards display so make sure the file is editable for any future adjustments.
