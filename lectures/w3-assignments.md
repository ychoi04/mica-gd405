## Main assignment
We will practice using variables(parameters) this week. Out goal is not to design a static form. We are more interested in the structure - how the forms are constructed. With the understanding of the structure, we create rules and system with code. Here, variables (or parameters) are data that make your type system respond to different conditions and create dynamic results.

1. Go back to one of your type design assignment from last week. 
1. Refine the design (formally and conceptually). This time, think about the rules that define your design across multiple letters. 
1. Think about how the design can be expanded to create a range of expressions.
1. Can you extract a few typorgraphic properties that you want to control? Identify them and apply at least two variables (`mouseX` and `mouseY`) instead of hard-coded numbers to control the properties. For instance, apply them to letter width, height, thickness, x-height, etc.
1. Test your sketch and refine as necessary.

### Deliverables
  - set your sketch size to 900 x 600 px.
  - you can use colors if you want, but keep *the background white*.
  - Save images(screen captures) of your design at different stages. 
  - Post everything on Google Drive.
  - Note that (1) you have to upload the entire folder, not just `pde` file, (2) the folder and file must have the same name.
