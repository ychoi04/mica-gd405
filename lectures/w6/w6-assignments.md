# Week 6 assignments

## Video lessons
Visit [the Kadenze Course](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-for-the-visual-arts-with-p5-js-i) and watch the videos:
- Session 6: Motion: Move and choreograph shapes


## Response
Watch [the talk](http://www.typotalks.com/videos/muir-mcneil-2/) from MuirMcNeil, and write a short response on the journal.


## Type in Pattern, Pattern in Type

- Create an interactive type pattern composition.
- You may use other graphic elements. Type itself can become a pattern, or type can be used in a pattern.
- Start with something very simple. Experiment, explore and iterate to get more interesting results.
- Focus on building *a system* that can create many variations of patterns, rather than creating only one version. Use variables/parameters to control form, spacing, color, number of repetitions, rhythms, etc.
- Make it interactive using mouse and/or keyboard interactions. Optionally, add slider/button controls.
- Map a key/button to save out an image.

### Deliverables
- At least 3 image files generated from your software. Choose the best ones.
- Post the images and codepen link (test!!) on Google Drive Week 6 folder.


### Checklist
Now you:
  - know how to use nested for loop structures.
  - can control the parameters to create desired results.
  - can control the flow of the program using variables and conditionals.
  - have organized the code (indents, comments) for future improvements and reusability.
