# Week 6 assignments

## Video lessons

Watch the videos below. Take notes, bring back questions:

 - [Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCu7JSkgl04&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ajGB2OI3hl5DZsD1Fw1WzR) (4 videos) from the Coding Train
 - Watch [the talk](http://www.typotalks.com/videos/muir-mcneil-2/) from MuirMcNeil.
 
## Type Design
- Create all twenty six alphabets plus a few more special characters of your choice (ie. question mark, quotations, period, etc.).
- All letter drawing codes should be in their own function definitions (ie. `drawA(), drawQuestionMark()`)
- Make two sketches:

### 1st sketch
Lay out all the letters by calling each function manually. You may have mouse/keyboard interactions (not to add any letters on screen, but to change other parameters related to the letters).

### 2ne sketch
Make your sketch interactive, where users can type in their own messages. Have proper margins, line breaks, etc. You won't be able to change the letterforms once it's added to the screen (we need to learn array/objects to be able to do that.), but you may still add mouse/keyboard interactions so that letterforms will be different for each keypress.

Optionally, you can add some graphical user interface elements to control some parameters. Look at **controlp5** library.
  
## Poster
Update your poster design based on the feedback, and bring in *11 x 17inch (vertical orientation only) printed poster* next week.
