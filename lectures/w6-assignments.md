 - Watch [the talk](http://www.typotalks.com/videos/muir-mcneil-2/) from MuirMcNeil.
 
## Type Design
- Create all twenty six alphabets plus a few more special characters of your choice (ie. question mark, quotations, period, etc.).
- All letter drawing codes should be in their own function definitions (ie. `drawA(), drawQuestionMark()`)
- Make two sketches:
  1. First, lay out all the letters by calling each function manually.
  1. Second, make your sketch interactive, where users can type in their own messages with proper margins, line breaks, etc.
