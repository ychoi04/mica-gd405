## Type design

1. Design all twenty six characters.
1. Set your sketch size to 900 (w) x 600 (h) pixels. i.e. `createCanvas(900, 600);`
1. clean up your code: commenting, indentation, line breaks, optimize.
1. Look back at your design: consistency, common parameters, details, range of expressions.
1. Using your type design, create an **interactive** type specimen/poster in p5.js. The idea of the specimen/poster here is loose. It's up to you how you want to treat this. 
1. Consider how the user may use your software. You can showcase the capabilities of your parametric design and/or place it in a context to help users understand better.
1. Post the sketch (the entire folder) on Google Drive.
