# Final Project

The final project is an open project as long as it is related to generative typography. The only requirement is to use some kind of external data in your project to drive typographic forms and/or layout. Look back at everything you have done so far - sketches, notes, assignments, etc.

You may make it as practical and functional, or as experimental and unconventional as you want, but make sure you are not just replicating an existing project. It is so easy to just copy and paste someone else's codes without understanding what is really going on. When you use other people's codes, use them as building blocks for your own ideas.

Define your own goals. What are you trying to achieve with your design? Your goal should be realistic. You want to challenge yourself in learning something new but the project must be finished by the end of the semester.

Do some research and come up with an interesting design concept. Collect your references and inspirations for both design and coding. Document everything.

How does working with code change your ideas of graphic design? Think about ways to expand your design. 

Some possibilities are:

- Parametric type design (either continuing earlier assignments or start a new one) and its use
- A typeface that responds to external data (ie. location, sound, temperature, etc.)
- A series of printed generative type posters 
- Interactive type posters
- Sensors to get external environmental data (ie. [Arduino board](https://www.arduino.cc))
- Dynamic identity system
- Type patterns generated through code
- Interactive storytelling through type
- A series of book covers generated from your type system
- A publication that uses your computational type system
- Live video input
- Dimensional typography using 3d printer
- Something experimental, something speculative...
- What else?

Again, it can take any format but make sure you are using external data (parameters) to control some aspects of typography.

Once you have your design concept, you need to make a first working prototype as quickly as possible. This is to see if it is realistic to pursue your idea, and also to identify which area you should devote your energy on. 

Break down your problems into smaller parts - break them until it is something you can solve. Make more working prototypes. Test. Reflect on it. Iterate and improve. 

Document the whole process. Save versions. Take notes. Take screenshots. Take videos. Organize your materials. Share your process with other people.

_Optionally, you can work as a team (max.2 people) although it is not required. If you are going to work as a team, it must be clear what each person's role is, and I will expect more from you in terms of the amount as well as the quality of the work. You may receive different gradings based on your participation and contribution._

## Requirements

At the end of the project, you will submit:
- Your code (it should run on anyone's computer)
- Other supporting materials (ie. sketches, screenshots, video, etc.)
- PDF Documentation: The format is up to you. You may use images, text, prototypes and/or video. Make this a formal presentation. Check the documentation from last year [here](http://mica-gd405.paperdove.com/2017/).
