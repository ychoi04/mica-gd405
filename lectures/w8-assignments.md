## Main assignment

- Finish your interactive **type** poster assignment.
- Push yourself. Don't settle with what's already working. Explore different ways of communication with animation and interaction.
- Do not replicate what's already out there, especially, the graphic styles that are already associated with the film. Use your own interpretations.
- Use the interactions and animation in meaningful ways. Do not just show off your skills but relate them to the contents you are working with.
- Find some excuses to try out new techniques you have learned (for loop, object, array, etc.)
- Do your own research in learning new concepts (more interactions? audio? video? web data feed?)
- Test. Test with people around you. Observe their reactions.
