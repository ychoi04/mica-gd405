# Week 6 assignments

## Video lessons

Watch the videos below. Take notes, bring back questions:

 - [Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCu7JSkgl04&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ajGB2OI3hl5DZsD1Fw1WzR) (4 videos) from the Coding Train
 - Watch [the talk](http://www.typotalks.com/videos/muir-mcneil-2/) from MuirMcNeil.


## Type in Pattern, Pattern in Type

- Create an interactive type pattern composition. (linear, radial, etc.)
- You may use other graphic elements. Type itself can become a pattern, or type can be used in a pattern.
- Start with something very simple. Experiment, explore and iterate to get more interesting results.
- Focus on building *a system* that can create many variations of patterns, rather than creating only one version. Use variables/parameters to control form, spacing, color, number of repetitions, rhythms, etc.
- use *for loop* structure to generate patterns.
- Make it interactive using mouse and/or keyboard interactions. 
- Optionally,
  - add slider/button controls (look at [controlp5 lbrary](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/)).
  - map a key/button to save out an image.

### Deliverables
- At least 3 image files generated from your software. Make many and choose the best ones.
- Post the sketch/images on Google Drive.


### Checklist
Now you:
  - know how to use nested for loop structures.
  - can control the parameters to create desired results.
  - can control the flow of the program using variables and conditionals.
  - have organized the code (indents, comments) for future improvements and reusability.
